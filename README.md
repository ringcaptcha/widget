RingCaptcha Widget
==================

A JavaScript based two-step verification widget.

Installation
------------

The fastest way to get started is to serve the widget from our own CDN.

```html
<div id="widget"></div>
<script src="https://cdn.ringcaptcha.com/widget/v2/bundle.min.js"></script>
<script>
var widget = new RingCaptcha.Widget('#widget', 'my_app_key');
</script>
```

### Requirements

 * Node.js 0.10+

### Preparation

Before building, customize the bundle:
* cp config.json.dist config.json
* Edit config.json
  * Change 'cdn' to point to 'http://localhost:4001' which is where we will deploy new code/changes
  * Change other config if required, e.g., 'locale' if you're adding a new locale, 'api' if you want to use dev api, etc.

If you're deploying to aws, customize:
* cp aws.json.dist aws.json
* Edit aws.json

### Building

Once you have your [environment setup](#requirements) ready, building the widget is really easy.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

At this point, you should have a `build` folder with the compiled files.

### Running Tests

To run the entire test suite, execute the following command:

```sh
$ npm test
```
