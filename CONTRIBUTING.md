Contributing
============

We love contributions. Here's a quick guide to get you started.

Our Contribution Process
------------------------

### Issues

Before submitting an issue, please check for [existing issues](https://github.com/ringcaptcha/widget/issues)
for duplicates and confirm that it hasn't been fixed already in the
[master branch](https://github.com/ringcaptcha/widget/commits/master).

The issue description must include a [whatsmybrowser.org](http://www.whatsmybrowser.org) link to ensure
that contributions may be reviewed without needless feedback loops.

### Pull Requests

Our contribution process follows the ideas of the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow).
Before submitting a pull request, please make sure that:

 1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!
 2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
 3. The test suite passes.
 4. Your code follows our [style guide](#style-guide).

The pull request description must include the following checklist at the top to ensure
that contributions may be reviewed without needless feedback loops and that your contributions
can be included as quickly as possible.
